# examplco3

The final version of the examplco demonstrator in Go for etcd.

The previous versions (examplco and examplco2) are maintained to stay in line with the articles.

This is the final version which includes all the code from the previous examples, plus extra code for the ordered 
queue examples from the third part of the article series.

It has been reorganised for easier consumption.

The articles are Essentially etcd [part 1](https://www.compose.io/articles/essentially-etcd/), 
[part 2](https://www.compose.io/articles/essentially-etcd-part-2-coordination/) and part 3 (to come).
